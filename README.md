### GHDLsim - Fast VHDL testbench simulation for Windows

The GHDLsim script is a tool that automate the process of running VHDL testbenches under a Windows enviroment.
The script needs to be placed in the same folder that contains the main VHDL testbench file. All the VHDL Component files
that are imported in the testbench will be automatically linked and compiled to the current project 
(VHDL Component files can also be placed inside additional subfolders).
